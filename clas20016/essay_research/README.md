## Research Goal

To determine whether the epithets for the word ship follow a pattern / can be predicted.

This is done by identifying features of the text that may be relevant, analysing the features and creating a classifier to predict the epithet. The more accurate the classifier, the more likely it is that the epithets follow a pattern.

## Repository instructions/pipeline
1. for preprocessing (feature cleaning and creation), run `preprocess_features.py`
2. to determine relationships between features, run `analyse_features.ipynb`
3. to investigate the best model, run `model.ipynb` and `model_filtered.ipynb`
4. to evaluate the accuracy of the final model, run `analysis.ipynb` and `analysis_filtered.ipynb`
