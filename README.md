# It's All Greek to Me

This repositoriy contains work/research I have completed relating to my Diploma of Language in which I majored in Ancient Greek.

Stopwords are listed in nominative singular (where revelant) thus designed for texts to be transformed first. I have used the stopword list from  https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-el
This process requires 'un-declining' and 'un-conjugating' words as well as restoring certain speech particles from crasis. 
Additionally, all graves accents are changed to acutes. Irregularities in accenting due to enclitics was ignored.


Disclaimer:

Much of this work is incomplete as it was not necessary for the class and is simply an interesting project to complete on the side time permitting.

Most statistics may be slightly inaccurate due to disparities in manuscripts.
